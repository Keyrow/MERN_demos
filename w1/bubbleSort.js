  Time Complexity
    - Best: O(n) when array is already sorted
    - Average: O(n^2) quadratic
    - Worst: O(n^2) quadratic when the array is reverse sorted

  Space: O(1) constant
  
  For review, create a function that uses BubbleSort to sort an unsorted array in-place.

  For every pair of adjacent indicies, swap them if the item on the left is larger than the item on the right until array is fully sorted
