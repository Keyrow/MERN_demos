/* 
  Given a square matrix (2d array) of integers
  Calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals
    - top left to bottom right diagonal
    - top right to bottom left diagonal

  Input:
  [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [9, 8, 9]
  ]   
  Output: 2

  left to right diagonal: 1 + 5 + 9 = 15
  right to left diagonal: 3 + 5 + 9 = 17
  absolute difference = 2
